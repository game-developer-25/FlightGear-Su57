# FlightGear-Su57

**Work In Progress â€“ Not Ready for Use**

This repository contains an early, incomplete version of the Su-57 (T-50 PAK FA) aircraft for use with the [FlightGear](https://www.flightgear.org) open-source flight simulator.
**This project is currently in development and is *not ready* for flying or general use.** 

Expected date of first useable version: end of the year (2025)

Check back later for updates. Contributions and collaboration may be welcome once the project reaches a usable state.

After it's ready, everybody can use this aircraft for non-commercial purposes, especially playing TopGun: Maverick with the F-14 Tomcat from the official hangar.
